The code for this project is attached in a file entitled data.py. Development was done through Jupyter Notebook.
To run the code, first download the data from the links included below. Then run the code, commenting out parts which
you do not wish to run. All key dependencies are imported, and must be intalled via pip if not previously included.
Code adapted and taken from outside sources is cited in comments. The sections are labeled based on the corresponding
analysis. Sections can be commented out to only focus on one portion of the analysis.
